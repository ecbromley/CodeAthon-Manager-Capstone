# CodeAthon-Manager-Capstone
#### Capstone project for SUNY Polytechnic Computer and Information Science.

A web-based system to support the programming competition model outlined in ["A Programming Competition Model for Small Live Contests"](/Resources/Confer_competition_model.pdf).

It should eventually include the following functionality: 
- Creating teams/individuals
- Setting up a specific competition and its problems/judging programs
- Receiving/compiling/running submissions through judging programs
- Capturing and posting scores and making them available to teams (and maybe outsider viewers)
- Showing final scores and ranks, etc.
